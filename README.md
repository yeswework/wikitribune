# Our open-source tools for WikiTribune

[WikiTribune](https://www.wikitribune.com/), a project initiated by Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales, aims to ‘fix the news’ by combining the work of a professional editorial team with contributions from citizen journalists who can provide additional information and help to eliminate bias and error.

The project requires a fine balance of freedom, trust and accountability, and we helped WikiTribune to extend WordPress's native functionality to:

* allow many people to open the same article for editing at the same time – with the [Fabrica Collaborative Editing](https://github.com/wikitribune/fabrica-collaborative-editing) plugin
* give professional editors control over publication of edits – with the [Fabrica Pending Revisions](https://github.com/wikitribune/fabrica-pending-revisions) plugin

We have jointly open-sourced the plugins with WikiTribune to help other civic media organisations, community journalism projects and multi-author WP sites who require similar functionality.

The plugins can be downloaded and forked from WikiTribune's GitHub via the links above.
